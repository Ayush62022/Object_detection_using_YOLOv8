## Introduction

Object detection is a crucial task in computer vision, enabling machines to identify and locate objects within images or videos. YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once version 8) is an advanced object detection algorithm known for its real-time processing speed and high accuracy. It divides the input image into a grid and predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities for objects within each grid cell, making it suitable for various applications.

## YOLOv8 Model

YOLOv8 builds upon previous versions of the YOLO algorithm, incorporating improvements in architecture and training techniques. It combines speed and accuracy, making it a popular choice for object detection tasks. The model architecture is optimized for real-time inference while maintaining high detection performance.
